        <div className="mb-4">
          Jack Daniel’s is much more than a whiskey brand — it’s a legacy of craftsmanship, heritage, and authenticity that has endured for over 150 years.
          Founded in 1866 by Jasper Newton “Jack” Daniel in the small town of Lynchburg, Tennessee, Jack Daniel’s has grown from a humble distillery into one of the most iconic and recognizable names in the world of whiskey.
          We pride ourselves on staying true to the original vision of our founder: creating a whiskey that is smooth, full-bodied, and unmistakably Tennessee.

          Our commitment to quality and tradition defines who we are. From the pure limestone spring water filtered through the surrounding caves of Lynchburg to the select grains carefully sourced for each batch, every ingredient is chosen with care.
          At the heart of our process lies the unique Lincoln County Charcoal mellowing—an artful filtering of the spirit through sugar maple charcoal that gives Jack Daniel’s its signature smoothness and character.
